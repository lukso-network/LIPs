## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the LIP.-->
An entry function enabling a contract to receive arbitrary information.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
Similar to a smart contract's fallback function, which allows a contract to be notified of an incoming transaction with a value, the [`universalReceiver(bytes32,bytes)`](#universalReceiver) function allows for any contract to receive information about any interaction.
This allows receiving contracts to react on incoming transfers or other interactions.


## Motivation
There are often the need to inform other smart contracts about actions another smart contract did perform.
A good example are token transfers, where the token smart contract should inform receiving contracts about the transfer.

By creating a universal function that many smart contracts implement, receiving of asset and information can be unified.

In cases where smart contracts function as a profile or wallet over a long time, an upgradable universal receiver can allow for future assets to be received, without the need for the interface to be changed.

## Specification

**LSP1-UniversalReceiver** interface id according to [ERC165]: `0x6bb56a14`.

Smart contracts implementing the LSP1UniversalReceiver standard MUST implement the [ERC165] `supportsInterface(..)` function and MUST support ERC165 and LSP1 interface ids.

Every contract that complies with the LSP1-UniversalReceiver standard MUST implement:

### Methods

#### universalReceiver

```solidity
function universalReceiver(bytes32 typeId, bytes memory data) external payable returns (bytes memory)
```

Allows to be called by any external contract to inform the contract about any incoming transfers, interactions or simple information. Can be customized to react on the different aspect of the call such as the typeId, the data sent, the caller or the value sent to the function, e.g, reacting on a token or a vault transfer. 

_Parameters:_

- `typeId` is the hash of a standard, or the type relative to the `data` received.

- `data` is a byteArray of arbitrary data. Receiving contracts should take the `typeId` in consideration to properly decode the `data`.

_Returns:_ `bytes` which can be used to encode response values.

> **Note:** the `universalReceiver(...)` function COULD be allowed to return no data (no return as the equivalent of the opcode instruction `return(memory_pointer, 0)`).
> If any `bytes` data is returned, bytes not conforming to the default ABI encoding will result in a revert. See the [specification for the abi-encoding of `bytes`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/abi-spec.html#formal-specification-of-the-encoding) for more details.

### Events

#### UniversalReceiver

```solidity
event UniversalReceiver(address indexed from, uint256 indexed value, bytes32 indexed typeId, bytes receivedData, bytes returnedValue);
```

This event MUST be emitted when the `universalReceiver` function is succesfully executed.

_Values:_

- `from` is the address calling the `universalReceiver(..)` function.

- `value` is the amount of value sent to the `universalReceiver(..)` function.

- `typeId` is the hash of a standard, or the type relative to the `data` received.

- `receivedData` is a byteArray of arbitrary data received.

- `returnedValue` is the data returned by the `universalReceiver(..)` function.


## UniversalReceiver Delegation

UniversalReceiver delegation allows to forward the `universalReceiver(..)` call on one contract to another external contract, allowing for upgradeability and changing behaviour of the initial `universalReceiver(..)` call.

### Motivation

The ability to react to upcoming actions with a logic hardcoded within the `universalReceiver(..)` function comes with a limitations, as only a fixed functionality can be coded or the `UniversalReceiver` be fired. This section explains a way to forward the call to the `universalReceiver(..)` function to an external smart contract to extend and change funcitonality over time.

The delegation works by simply forwarding a call to the `universalReceiver(..)` function to a delegated smart contract calling the `universalReceiver(..)` function on the external smart contract.
As the external smart contract doesn't know about the inital `msg.sender` and the `msg.value`, this specification proposes to add these values to the `msg.data`. This allows the external contract to strip them from the `msg.data` and understand the address and value of the inital call to the extended smart contract.


### Specification

The **UniversalReceiverDelegate** is an optional extension. It allows the `universalReceiver(..)` function to delegate its functionality to an external contract that can be customized to react differently based on the `typeId` and the `data` received. 

The `universalReceiver(..)` function on the initial smart contract forwards the call to the `universalReceiver(..)` on the **UniversalReceiverDelegate** contract and append the calldata with 52 extra bytes as follows:

- The `msg.sender` calling the initial `universalReceiver(..)` function without any pad, MUST be 20 bytes.
- The `msg.value` received to the initial `universalReceiver(..)` function, MUST be 32 bytes.

The **UniversalReceiverDelegate** smart contract, can then understand the `msg.sender` and `msg.value` of the initial smart contract, or ignore the appended data.

If the contract implementing the LSP1 standard is an ERC725Y, the address of the **UniversalReceiverDelegate** contract COULD be stored under the following ERC725Y data key:

```json
{
    "name": "LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegate",
    "key": "0x0cfc51aec37c55a4d0b1a65c6255c4bf2fbdf6277f3cc0730c45b828b6db8b47",
    "keyType": "Singleton",
    "valueType": "address",
    "valueContent": "Address"
}
```

Additionally, some specific **UniversalReceiverDelegate** contracts COULD be mapped to react on specific `typeId`. The address of each of these contracts for each specific `typeId` COULD be stored under the following ERC725Y data key:

```json
{
    "name": "LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegate:<bytes32>",
    "key": "0x0cfc51aec37c55a4d0b10000<bytes32>",
    "keyType": "Mapping",
    "valueType": "address",
    "valueContent": "Address"
}
```

The `<bytes32\>` in the data key name corresponds to the `typeId` passed to the `universalReceiver(..)` function. For example, for the typeId `0xcafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafebeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeef`, the data key above will be constructed as follow:

```
0x0cfc51aec37c55a4d0b10000cafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe
```

## Rationale
This is an abstraction of the ideas behind Ethereum [ERC223](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/223) and [ERC777](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777), that contracts are called when they are receiving tokens or other assets. With this proposal, we can allow contracts to receive any information over a standardised interface. As this function is generic and only the send `typeId` changes, smart contract accounts that can upgrade its behaviour using the **UniversalReceiverDelegate** technique can be created. UniversalReceiverDelegate functionality COULD be implemented using `call`, or `delegatecall`, both of which have different security properties.

## Implementation

An implementation can be found in the [lukso-network/lsp-smart-contracts](https://github.com/lukso-network/lsp-smart-contracts/tree/develop/contracts/LSP1UniversalReceiver) repository.

### UniversalReceiver Example:

After transfering token from `TokenABC` to `MyWallet`, the owner of `MyWallet` contract can know looking at the UniversalReceiver event emitted that the `typeId` is `_TOKEN_RECEIVING_HASH` and then he could look into the `data` to know the token sender address and the amount sent.

contract TokenABC {

    // Hash of the word `_TOKEN_RECEIVING_HASH`
    bytes32 constant public _TOKEN_RECEIVING_HASH = 0x7901c95ea4b5fe1fba45bb8c10d7ddabf715dea547785f933d8be283925c4883;

    bytes4 _INTERFACE_ID_LSP1 = 0x6bb56a14;

    function sendToken(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        balance[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balance[to] += amount;
        _informTheReceiver(to, amount); 
    }

    function _informTheReceiver(address receiver, uint256 amount) internal {
        // If the contract receiving the tokens supports LSP1 InterfaceID then call the unviersalReceiver function
        if(ERC165Checker.supportsInterface(receiver,_INTERFACE_ID_LSP1)){
            ILSP1(receiver).universalReceiver(_TOKEN_RECEIVING_HASH, abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, amount));
        }
    }
}

contract MyWallet is ERC165, ILSP1 {

    bytes4 _INTERFACE_ID_LSP1 = 0x6bb56a14;

    constructor() public {
        _registerInterface(_INTERFACE_ID_LSP1);
    }

    function universalReceiver(bytes32 typeId, bytes memory data) public payable returns (bytes memory) {
        emit UniversalReceiver(msg.sender, msg.value, typeId, data, 0x);
        return 0x0;
    }
}
```

### UniversalReceiverDelegate Example:

This example is the same example written above except that `MyWallet` contract now delegate the universalReceiver functionality to a UniversalReceiverDelegate contract.

The `TokenABC` contract will inform `MyWallet` contract about the transfer by calling the `universalReceiver(..)` function and this function will call the `universalReceiver(..)` function on the UniversalReceiverDelegate address set by the owner, to react on the transfer accordingly.
