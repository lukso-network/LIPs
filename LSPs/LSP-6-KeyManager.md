## Simple Summary

This standard describes a `KeyManager` contract with a set of pre-defined permissions for addresses. A KeyManager contract can control an [ERC725Account] like account, or any other [ERC725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-725.md) smart contract.

## Abstract

This standard allows for controlling addresses to be restricted through multiple permissions, to act on and through this KeyManager on a controlled smart contract (for example an [ERC725Account]).

The KeyManager functions as a gateway for the [ERC725Account] restricting an address actions based on set permissions.

Permissions are described in the [Permissions section](#permissions). Furthermore addresses can be restricted to only talk to certain other smart contracts or address, specific functions or smart contracts supporting only specifc standard interfaces.

The Permissions are stored under the ERC725Y data key-value store of the linked [ERC725Account], and can therefore survive an upgrade to a new KeyManager contract.

The flow of a transactions is as follows:

![lsp6-key-manager-flow-chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31145285/129574099-9eba52d4-4f82-4f11-8ac5-8bfa18ce97d6.jpeg)

## Motivation

The benefit of a KeyManager is to externalise the permission logic from [ERC725Y and X](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-725.md) contracts (such as an [ERC725Account]). This allows for such logic to be upgraded without needing to change the core [ERC725Account] contract.

Storing the permissions at the core [ERC725Account] itself, allows it to survive KeyManager upgrades and opens the door to add additional KeyManager logic in the future, without loosing already set address permissions.

## Specification

**LSP6-KeyManager** interface id according to [ERC165]: `0x23f34c62`.

Smart contracts implementing the LSP6 standard MUST implement and support the following standard and their interfaces:

- [ERC165]
- [ERC1271]
- [LSP20-CallVerification]
- [LSP25-ExecuteRelayCall]
- the LSP6 interface functions defined below.

Every contract that supports the LSP6 standard MUST implement:

### Methods

#### target

```solidity
function target() external view returns (address)
```

Returns the `address` of the target smart contract controlled by this Key Manager. The controlled smart contract can be one of the following:

- ERC725X contract
- ERC725Y contract
- an ERC725 contract, implementing both ERC725X and ERC725Y (e.g: an [ERC725Account]).

#### isValidSignature

```solidity
function isValidSignature(bytes32 hash, bytes memory signature) external view returns (bytes4);
```

This function is part of the [ERC1271] specification, with additional requirements as follows:

- MUST recover the address from the hash and the signature and return the [ERC1721 success value] if the address recovered have the [**SIGN Permission**](#sign), if not, MUST return the [ERC1271 fail value].

#### lsp20VerifyCall

```solidity
function lsp20VerifyCall(address caller, uint256 value, bytes memory receivedCalldata) external returns (bytes4 returnedStatus);
```

This function is part of the [LSP20-CallVerification] specification, with additional requirements as follows:

- MUST be called only by the linked [target](#target).

- MUST verify the permission of the **`caller`** based on the **`receivedCalldata`** as defined in the [permission](#permissions) section.

- MUST emit the [PermissionsVerified](#permissionsverified) event after verifying permissions.

- MUST set the reentrancy guard to true if the first 4 bytes of `receivedCalldata` are any function other than `setData(..)`/`setDataBatch(..)` and check for reentrancy permission if the call was reentrant.

- MUST return the success value with the `0x01` bytes that indicates that `lsp20VerifyCallResult(..)` MUST be invoked.

#### lsp20VerifyCallResult

```solidity
function lsp20VerifyCallResult(bytes32 callHash, bytes memory callResult) external returns (bytes4 returnedStatus);
```

This function is part of the [LSP20-CallVerification] specification, with additional requirements as follows:

- MUST be called only by the linked [target](#target).

- MUST set the reentrancy guard to false if it's set to true.

- MUST return the success value.

#### executeRelayCall

```solidity
function executeRelayCall(
    bytes memory signature,
    uint256 nonce,
    uint256 validityTimestamps,
    bytes memory payload
)
    external
    payable
    returns (bytes memory)
```

This function is part of the [LSP25-ExecuteRelayCall] specification, with additional requirements as follows.

- The Key Manager's address MUST be used for the `<Implementation address>` in the LSP25 [**Signature Format**](./LSP-25-ExecuteRelayCall.md#signature-format) when generating signature for execute relay calls.
- The address of the signer recovered from the signature MUST have the right permissions to execute the calldata `payload`.
- The event `PermissionsVerified` MUST be emitted after verifying the permissions of the signer address recovered.

#### executeRelayCallBatch

```solidity
function executeRelayCallBatch(
    bytes[] memory signatures,
    uint256[] memory nonces,
    uint256[] memory validityTimestamps,
    uint256[] memory values,
    bytes[] memory payloads
)
    external
    payable
    returns (bytes[] memory)
```

This function is part of the [LSP25-ExecuteRelayCall] specification, with additional requirements as follows.

- The Key Manager's address MUST be used for the `<Implementation address>` in the LSP25 [**Signature Format**](./LSP-25-ExecuteRelayCall.md#signature-format) to generate each signatures in the batch.
- The address of the signer recovered **from each signature** in the `signatures[]` array MUST have the right permissions to execute the the associated calldata payload in the `payloads[]` array.
- The event `PermissionsVerified` MUST be emitted after verifying the permissions of **each signer address recovered**.

#### execute

```solidity
function execute(bytes memory payload) external payable returns (bytes memory)
```

Execute a payload on the linked [target](#target) contract.

MUST fire the [PermissionsVerified event](#permissionsverified).

_Parameters:_

- `payload`: The abi-encoded function call to be executed on the linked target contract.

_Returns:_ `bytes` , the returned data as abi-decoded bytes of the call on ERC725 smart contract, if the call succeeded, otherwise revert with a reason-string.

_Requirements:_

- The first 4 bytes of the `payload` payload MUST correspond to one of the function selector on the ERC725 smart contract such as:

#### executeBatch

```solidity
function executeBatch(uint256[] memory values, bytes memory payloads[]) external payable returns (bytes[] memory)
```

Execute a batch of payloads on the linked [target](#target) contract.

```

MUST be fired when the permissions of a call was successfully verified.

### Permissions

The permissions MUST be checked against the following address, depending on
the function/method being called:

- against the **caller** parameter in the cases of [`lsp20VerifyCall(address,uint256,bytes)`](#lsp20verifycall).

- against the **caller** in the cases of [`execute(bytes)`](#execute) and [`executeBatch(uint256[],bytes[])`](#executebatch).

### ERC725Y Data Keys

**The permissions that the KeyManager reads, are stored on the controlled-contracts ERC725Y data key value store (for example an [ERC725Account](./LSP-0-ERC725Account.md))**

The following ERC725Y data keys are used to read permissions and restrictions of certain addresses.

These data keys are based on the [LSP2-ERC725YJSONSchema](./LSP-2-ERC725YJSONSchema.md) standard, and use the key type **[`MappingWithGrouping`](./LSP-2-ERC725YJSONSchema.md#mappingwithgrouping)**

#### AddressPermissions[]

```json
{
  "name": "AddressPermissions[]",
  "key": "0xdf30dba06db6a30e65354d9a64c609861f089545ca58c6b4dbe31a5f338cb0e3",
  "keyType": "Array",
  "valueType": "address",
  "valueContent": "Address"
}
```

Contains an array of addresses, that have some permission set. This is mainly useful for interfaces to know which address holds which permissions.

Note that **this data key is OPTIONAL**. It is not necessary to add a controller under this data key if setting a new controller under [`AddressPermissions:Permissions:<address>`](#addresspermissionspermissionsaddress)

For more information about how to access each index of the `AddressPermissions[]` array, see: [ERC725Y JSON Schema > `keyType` `Array`](./LSP-2-ERC725YJSONSchema.md#array)

#### AddressPermissions:Permissions:\<address\>

```json
{
  "name": "AddressPermissions:Permissions:<address>",
  "key": "0x4b80742de2bf82acb3630000<address>",
  "keyType": "MappingWithGrouping",
  "valueType": "bytes32",
  "valueContent": "BitArray"
}
```

Contains a set of permissions for an address. Permissions defines what an address **can do on** the target contract (_eg: edit the data key-value store via SETDATA_), or **can perform on behalf of** the target.

Since the `valueType` of this data key is `bytes32`, up to 255 different permissions can be defined. This includes the [default permissions](#permissions) defined. Custom permissions can be defined on top of the default one.

#### AddressPermissions:AllowedCalls:\<address\>

```json
{
  "name": "AddressPermissions:AllowedCalls:<address>",
  "key": "0x4b80742de2bf393a64c70000<address>",
  "keyType": "MappingWithGrouping",
  "valueType": "(bytes4,address,bytes4,bytes4)[CompactBytesArray]",
  "valueContent": "(BitArray,Address,Bytes4,Bytes4)"
}
```

Contains a compact bytes array of call restrictions, addresses, interfaceIds and function selectors a controller address is allowed to execute and interact with.

Each allowed call is made of four elements concatenated together as a tuple that forms a final `bytes32` long value.

The full list of allowed calls MUST be constructed as a [CompactBytesArray](./LSP-2-ERC725YJSONSchema.md#bytescompactbytesarray) according to [LSP2-ERC725YJSONSchema] as follow:

```js
<0020> <bytes4 restrictionOperations> <bytes20 allowedAddress> <bytes4 allowedInterfaceId> <bytes4 allowedFunction> <0020> ... <0020> ...
```

> **NB:** the three dots `...` are placeholders for `<bytes4 callRestrictions> <bytes20 allowedAddress> <bytes4 allowedInterfaceId> <bytes4 allowedFunction>` and used for brevity.

- `0020`: **0020** in decimals is **32**, the total number of bytes of the four elements below concatenated together.
- `callRestrictions`: A bitArray that represents the list of restricted call types applied for this allowed call (address - interfaceId - function).

  The call restrictions are defined with specific bits, starting from the least significant bit (the rightmost bit):

  - transferValue `00000001`
  - call `00000010`
  - staticcall `00000100`
  - delegatecall `00001000`

  Custom implementations of the LSP6 Standard can add more operations as needed.

- `allowedAddress`: The address called by the target contract.
- `allowedInterfaceId`: The ERC165 interface id being supported by the contract called from the target.
- `allowedFunction`: The function selector being called on the contract called by the target contract.

- If the value of the data key is **empty**, execution is disallowed.

- `restrictionOperations` MUST NOT discarded.

- Check is discarded for an element if the value is full `ff` bytes. e.g, `0xffffffff` for interfaceIds and function selectors and `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` for addresses. There MUST be at most 2 discarded checks, meaning `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` data key is disallowed.

**Example 1:**

If controller A has [CALL](#permissions) permission, and have the following value for AllowedCalls:

```
0x002000000002cafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe11223344bb11bb11
```

The `restrictionOperations` is **`0x00000002`**, meaning that the restrictions above only applies when the operation **[CALL](https://github.com/ERC725Alliance/ERC725/blob/develop/docs/ERC-725.md#execute)** is being executed.

The controller A is allowed to interact via the **CALL** operation with the function selector **`0xbb11bb11`** on the **`0xcafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe`** address as long as the address supports **`0x11223344`** interfaceId through [ERC165].

<br>

**Example 2:**

If controller B has [DELEGATECALL](#permissions) permission, and have the following value for AllowedCalls:

```
0x002000000004cafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafeffffffffffffff002000000004ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff68686868ffffffff
```

The `restrictionOperations` on both elements is **`0x00000004`**, it means that the restrictions above only applies when the operation **[DELEGATECALL](https://github.com/ERC725Alliance/ERC725/blob/develop/docs/ERC-725.md#execute)** is being executed.

The controller B is allowed to interact with:

- the address **`0xcafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe`** **only via DELEGATECALL** without any restriction on the interfaceId or the function selector.
- **any address** supporting the **`0x68686868`** interfaceId without any restriction on the function.

<br>

**Example 3:**

If controller B has [DELEGATECALL](#permissions) permission, and have the following value for AllowedCalls:

```
0x002000000002cafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe11223344bb11bb11
```

The `restrictionOperations` is **`0x00000002`**, it means that the restrictions above only applies when the operation **[CALL](https://github.com/ERC725Alliance/ERC725/blob/develop/docs/ERC-725.md#execute)** is being executed.

Given that the controller B have the **DELEGATECALL** Permission and the restrictions only applies for the **CALL** operation, any execution of **DELEGATECALL** operation will fail even to the function **`0xbb11bb11`** on **`0xcafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe`** address.

<br>

**Example 4:**

If controller B has [TRANSFERVALUE](#permissions) and [CALL](#permissions) permissions, and have the following value for AllowedCalls:

```
0x002000000003cafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe11223344bb11bb11
```

The `callRestrictions` is **`0x00000003`**, it means that the restrictions above applies when the operation **[CALL](https://github.com/ERC725Alliance/ERC725/blob/develop/docs/ERC-725.md#execute)** or **[TRANSFERVALUE](https://github.com/ERC725Alliance/ERC725/blob/develop/docs/ERC-725.md#execute)** is being executed.

The controller B is allowed to **CALL** or **TransferValue** to:

- the contract deployed at address **`0xcafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe`** as long as this contract supports the interfaceId **`0x11223344`** through [ERC165].
- only the function with selector **`0xbb11bb11`** on this contract.
- this function on this contract with or without transferring value at the same time (because of the additional **TransferValue** in the `callRestrictions`).

<br>

**Example 5:**

If controller B has [TRANSFERVALUE](#permissions) and [CALL](#permissions) permissions, and have the following value for AllowedCalls:

```
0x002000000001cafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe11223344bb11bb11002000000002ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff68686868ffffffff
```

Each element of the compact bytes array have a different `restrictionOperations`:

- **`0x000000001`** for the first element allowing the controller B to only **TransferValue** to the function **`0xbb11bb11`** on **`0xcafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe`** address as long as the address supports **`0x11223344`** interfaceId through [ERC165].

- **`0x000000002`** for the second element allowing the controller B to only **Call** any function on any contract that support the interface ID **`0x68686868`** through [ERC165].

#### AddressPermissions:AllowedERC725YDataKeys:\<address\>

```json
{
  "name": "AddressPermissions:AllowedERC725YDataKeys:<address>",
  "key": "0x4b80742de2bf866c29110000<address>",
  "keyType": "MappingWithGrouping",
  "valueType": "bytes[CompactBytesArray]",
  "valueContent": "Bytes"
}
```

Contains a compact bytes array of dynamic ERC725Y data keys that the `address` is restricted to modify in case of setting normal data with [SETDATA](#setdata) permission.

- If the value of the data key is **empty**, setting data is disallowed.

The compact bytes array MUST be constructed in this format according to [LSP2-ERC725YJSONSchema]:

```js
<length of the data key prefix> <data key prefix>
```

- `length of the data key prefix`: The length of the prefix of the data key which the rest is dynamic. MUST be a number between `1` and `32`.
- `data key prefix`: The prefix of the data key to be checked against the data keys being set.

Below is an example based on a [LSP2 Mapping](./LSP-2-ERC725YJSONSchema.md#Mapping) key type, where first word = `MyCoolGroupName`, and second word = `MySuperItem`.

```js
name: "MyCoolGroupName:MySuperItem";
key: 0x49b3e05bd43c5ac82f1000000a0b207005afb968993d50cd35b2b56d5531a7e1;
```

<br>

**Example 1:**

- If address A has [SETDATA](#setdata) permission, and have the following value for AllowedERC725YDataKeys:

```
> 0x 0020 49b3e05bd43c5ac82f1000000a0b207005afb968993d50cd35b2b56d5531a7e1
> 0x002049b3e05bd43c5ac82f1000000a0b207005afb968993d50cd35b2b56d5531a7e1
```

> 0020 (32 in decimals) is the length of the data key to be set.

Resolve to:

Address A is only allowed to set the value for the data key attached above.

<br>

**Example 2:**

- If address B has [SETDATA](#setdata) permission, and have the following value for AllowedERC725YDataKeys:

```
> 0x 000a 49b3e05bd43c5ac82f10 0020 beefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeef
> 0x000a49b3e05bd43c5ac82f100020beefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeefbeef
```

> 000a (10 in decimals) is the length of the `49b3e05bd43c5ac82f10` prefix

Resolve to:

Address B is only allowed to set the value for the data `0xbeefbeef..beef` data key and any data key that starts with `0x49b3e05bd43c5ac82f10`.

By setting the value to `0x49b3e05bd43c5ac82f10` in the list of allowed ERC725Y data keys, one address can set any data key **starting with the first word `MyCoolGroupName:...`**. This means that this address can set any sub-mapping data keys of `MyCoolGroupName` (not only the sub-mapping `MySuperItem` from the example above).

## Rationale

<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

This standard was inspired by how files permissions are designed in UNIX based file systems.

Files are assigned permissions as a 3 digit numbers, where each of the 3 digits is an octal value representing a set of permissions.
The octal value is calculated as the sum of permissions, where _read_ = **4**, _write_ = **2**, and _execute_ = **1**

To illustrate, for a file set with permission `755`, the group permission (second digit) would be _read_ and _execute_ (See figure below). Each number is simply a **three binary placeholder, each one holding the number that correspond to the access level in r, w, x order**.

## Implementation

<!--The implementations must be completed before any LIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the LIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->

A implementation can be found in the [lukso-network/universalprofile-smart-contracts](https://github.com/lukso-network/lsp-universalprofile-smart-contracts/blob/main/contracts/LSP6KeyManager/LSP6KeyManager.sol);
The below defines the JSON interface of the target(#target) contract.
