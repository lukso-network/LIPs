## Simple Summary

This standard describes a version of an [ERC725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-725.md) smart contract, that represents a blockchain account.
 
## Abstract

This standard, defines a blockchain-based account system that can be used by humans, machines, or other smart contracts.

The primary features of this account are:

- **Attaching information**: via [ERC725Y](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-725.md#erc725y), allowing the addition of information even after deployment.

- **Executing**: via [ERC725X](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-725.md#erc725x), enabling the account to call functions on other contracts with different operations, transfer native tokens to addresses, and deploy new contracts.

- **Verifying signatures**: via [ERC1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271)

- **Receiving notifications of incoming and outgoing transactions**: via [LSP1-UniversalReceiver](./LSP-1-UniversalReceiver.md), enabling the account to be aware of assets or any other information and react accordingly (e.g., denying specific tokens)

- **Owning and controlling the account**: via [LSP14-Ownable2Step](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-14-Ownable2Step.md), ensuring transfer of ownership is secured through a 2-step process.

- **Supporting new functions and interfaceIds**: via [LSP17-ContractExtension](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-17-ContractExtension.md), allowing the account to extend and support new standardized functions over time

- **Interacting with the account in a unified way**: via [LSP20-CallVerification](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-20-CallVerification.md), enabling direct function calls on the account, with verification occurring on the owner if it is a contract.

## Motivation

Using EOAs as accounts makes it hard to reason about the actor behind an address. Using EOAs have multiple disadvantages:
- The public key is the address that mostly holds assets, meaning if the private key leaks or get lost, all asstes are lost
- No information can be easily attached to the address thats readable by interfaces or smart contracts
- Security is not changeable, so proper precautions of securing the private key has to be taken from the generation of the EOA.
- Recevied assets can not be tracked in the state of the account, but can only be retrieved to external block explorers.

To make the usage of Blockchain infrastructures easier we need to use a smart contract account, rather that EOAs directly as account system.
This allows us to:

- Make security upgradeable via a key manager smart contract (e.g. [LSP6 KeyManager](./LSP-6-KeyManager.md))
- Allow any action that an EOA can do, and even add the ability to use `create2` through [ERC725X](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-725.md#erc725x)
- Allow the account to be informed and react to receiving assets through [LSP1 UniversalReceiver](./LSP-1-UniversalReceiver.md)
- Define a number of data key-values pairs to attach profile and other information through additional standards like [LSP3 UniversalProfile-Metadata](./LSP-3-UniversalProfile-Metadata.md)
- Allow signature verification through [ERC1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271)
- can execute any smart contract and deploy smart contracts
- is highly extensible though additional standardisation of the key/value data stored.


## Specification

**LSP0-ERC725Account** interface id according to [ERC165]: `0x3e89ad98`.

_This `bytes4` interface id is calculated as the XOR of the selector of [`batchCalls`](#batchcalls) function and the following standards: ERC725Y, ERC725X, LSP1-UniversalReceiver, ERC1271-isValidSignature, LSP14Ownable2Step, LSP17Extendable and LSP20CallVerification_.

Smart contracts implementing the LSP0 standard MUST implement the [ERC165] `supportsInterface(..)` function and MUST support the LSP0, ERC725X, ERC725Y, ERC1271, LSP1, LSP14, LSP17 and LSP20 interface ids.

### Methods

Smart contracts implementing the LSP0 standard MUST implement all of the functions listed below:

#### receive

```solidity
receive() external payable;
```

The receive function allows for receiving native tokens.

MUST emit a [`ValueReceived`] event when receiving native token.


#### fallback

```solidity
fallback() external payable;
```

This function is part of the [LSP17] specification, with additional requirements as follows:

- MUST be payable.
- MUST emit a [`ValueReceived`] event if value was sent alongside some calldata.
- MUST return if the data sent to the contract is less than 4 bytes in length.
- MUST check for address of the extension under the following ERC725Y Data Key, and call the extension and behave according to [LSP17-ContractExtension] specification.

```json
{
    "name": "LSP17Extension:<bytes4>",
    "key": "0xcee78b4094da860110960000<bytes4>",
    "keyType": "Mapping",
    "valueType": "address",
    "valueContent": "Address"
}
```

> <bytes4\> is the `functionSelector` called on the account contract. Check [LSP2-ERC725YJSONSchema] to learn how to encode the key.

- MUST NOT revert when there is no extension set for `0x00000000`.


#### supportsInterface

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) external view returns (bool);
```

This function is part of the [ERC165] specification, with additional requirements as follows:

- If the interfaceId being queried is not supported by the contract or inherited contracts, the data key attached below MUST be retrieved from the ERC725Y storage.

  - If there is no address, execution end normally.


```json
{
    "name": "LSP17Extension:<bytes4>",
    "key": "0xcee78b4094da860110960000<bytes4>",
    "keyType": "Mapping",
    "valueType": "address",

- When the owner is a contract, it will call the `isValidsignature(bytes32,bytes)` function on the owner contract, and return the magicValue if the function returns the magicValue. In any other case such as non-standard return value or revert, it will return the [failure value](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1271.md#specification) indicating that the signature is not valid.

#### universalReceiver

```solidity
function universalReceiver(bytes32 typeId, bytes memory receivedData) external payable returns (bytes memory);
```

This function is part of the [LSP1] specification, with additional requirements as follows:

- MUST emit a [`ValueReceived`] event before external calls if the function receives native tokens.

- If an `address` is stored under the data key attached below and this address is a contract:
  - forwards the call to the [`universalReceiver(bytes32,bytes)`] function on the contract at this address **ONLY IF** this contract supports the [LSP1UniversalReceiver interface id].
  - if the contract at this address does not supports the [LSP1UniversalReceiver interface id], execution continues normally.
  
- If there is no `address` stored under this data key, execution continues normally. 

The `msg.data` is appended with the caller address as bytes20 and the `msg.value` received as bytes32 before calling the external contract, allowing the receiving contract to know the initial caller and the value sent.

```json
{
  "name": "LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegate",
  "key": "0x0cfc51aec37c55a4d0b1a65c6255c4bf2fbdf6277f3cc0730c45b828b6db8b47",
  "keyType": "Singleton",
  "valueType": "address",
  "valueContent": "Address"
}
```

- If an `address` is stored under the data key attached below and this address is a contract:
  - forwards the call to the [`universalReceiver(bytes32,bytes)`] function on the contract at this address **ONLY IF** this contract supports the [LSP1UniversalReceiver interface id].
  - if the contract at this address does not supports the [LSP1UniversalReceiver interface id], execution continues normally.

- If there is no `address` stored under this data key, execution continues normally. 

The `msg.data` is appended with the caller address as bytes20 and the `msg.value` received as bytes32 before calling the external contract, allowing the receiving contract to know the initial caller and the value sent.

```json
{
  "name": "LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegate:<bytes32>",
  "key": "0x0cfc51aec37c55a4d0b10000<bytes32>",
  "keyType": "Mapping",
  "valueType": "address",
  "valueContent": "Address"
}
```

> <bytes32\> is the `typeId` passed to the `universalReceiver(..)` function. Check [LSP2-ERC725YJSONSchema] to learn how to encode the key.

- MUST return the returned value of the `universalReceiver(bytes32,bytes)` function on both retrieved contract abi-encoded as bytes. If there is no addresses stored under the data keys above or the call was not forwarded to them, the return value is the two empty bytes abi-encoded as bytes. 

- MUST emit a [UniversalReceiver] event if the function was successful.

### Events

#### ValueReceived

```solidity
event ValueReceived(address indexed sender, uint256 indexed value);
```

MUST be emitted when a native token transfer was received.


### ERC725Y Data Keys

#### LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegate

```json
{
    "name": "LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegate",
    "key": "0x0cfc51aec37c55a4d0b1a65c6255c4bf2fbdf6277f3cc0730c45b828b6db8b47",
    "keyType": "Singleton",
    "valueType": "address",
    "valueContent": "Address"
}
```

If the account delegates its universal receiver functionality to another smart contract, this smart contract address MUST be stored under the data key attached above. This call to this contract is performed when the `universalReceiver(bytes32,bytes)` function of the account is called and can react on the whole call regardless of typeId. 

Check [LSP1-UniversalReceiver] and [LSP2-ERC725YJSONSchema] for more information.

#### Mapped LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegate

```json
{
    "name": "LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegate:<bytes32>",
    "key": "0x0cfc51aec37c55a4d0b10000<bytes32>",
    "keyType": "Mapping",
    "valueType": "address",
    "valueContent": "Address"
}
```

The `<bytes32\>` in the data key name corresponds to the `typeId` passed to the `universalReceiver(..)` function. 

> **Warning**
> When constructing this data key for a specific `typeId`, unique elements of the typeId SHOULD NOT be on the right side because of trimming rules.
> 
> The `<bytes32>` is trimmed on the right side to keep only the first 20 bytes. Therefore, implementations SHOULD ensure that the first 20 bytes are unique to avoid clashes.
> For example, the `bytes32 typeId` below:
> 
> ```
> 0x1111222233334444555566667777888899990000aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff
> ```
> 
> will be trimmed to `0x1111222233334444555566667777888899990000`.
> 
> See the section about the trimming rules for the key type [`Mapping`](./LSP-2-ERC725YJSONSchema.md#mapping) in [LSP2-ERC725YJSONSchema] to learn how to encode this data key.

If the account delegates its universal receiver functionality to another smart contract, this smart contract address MUST be stored under the data key attached above. This call to this contract is performed when the `universalReceiver(bytes32,bytes)` function of the account is called with a specific typeId that it can react on. 

Check [LSP1-UniversalReceiver] and [LSP2-ERC725YJSONSchema] for more information.

#### LSP17Extension

```json
{
    "name": "LSP17Extension:<bytes4>",
    "key": "0xcee78b4094da860110960000<bytes4>",
    "keyType": "Mapping",
    "valueType": "address",
    "valueContent": "Address"
}
```

> <bytes4\> is the `functionSelector` called on the account contract. Check [LSP2-ERC725YJSONSchema] to learn how to encode the key.

If there is a function called on the account and the function does not exist, the fallback function lookup an address stored under the data key attached above and forwards the call to it with the value of the `msg.sender` and `msg.value` appended as extra calldata.

Check [LSP17-ContractExtension] and [LSP2-ERC725YJSONSchema] for more information.


### Graffiti 

Graffiti refers to the arbitrary messages or data sent to an **LSP0-ERC725Account** contract that do not match any existing function selectors, such as `execute(..)`, `setData(..)`, etc. These bytes, often carrying a message or additional information, are usually not intended to invoke specific functions within the contract. 

When the account is called with specific bytes that do not match any function selector, it will first check its storage to see if there are any extensions set for these function selectors (bytes). If no extension is found, the call will typically revert. However, to emulate the behavior of calling an Externally Owned Account (EOA) with random bytes (which always passes), an exception has been made for the `0x00000000` selector.

When the account is called with data that starts with `0x00000000`, it will first check for extensions. If none are found, the call will still pass, allowing it to match the behavior of calling an EOA and enabling the ability to send arbitrary messages to the account. For example, one might receive a message like "This is a gift" while sending native tokens. 

Additionally, it is possible to set an extension for the `0x00000000` selector. With this custom extension, you can define specific logic that runs when someone sends graffiti to your account. For instance, you may choose to disallow sending graffiti by reverting the transaction, impose a fee for sending graffiti, or emit the graffiti on an external contract. This flexibility allows for various use cases and interactions with graffiti in the LSP0ERC725Account contracts.

## Rationale

The ERC725Y general data key-value store allows for the ability to add any kind of information to the the account contract, which allows future use cases. The general executor allows full interactability with any smart contract or address. And the universal receiver allows reacting to any future asset received.

## Implementation

An implementation can be found in the [lukso-network/lsp-smart-contracts] repository.
