## Simple Summary
This standard describes a set of [ERC725Y](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-725.md) data key values to store addresses of received assets in a [ERC725Y](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-725.md) smart contract.

## Abstract
This data key value standard describes a set of data keys that can be added to an [ERC725Y](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-725.md) smart contract to describe received assets:

- `LSP5ReceivedAssets[]` is an [LSP2 array](./LSP-2-ERC725YJSONSchema.md) of addresses.
- `LSP5ReceivedAssetsMap` is a dynamic address mapping, which contains:
  - an [ERC165 interface ID](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165) to easily identify the standard used by the mapped asset smart contract
  - and the index in the `LSP5ReceivedAssets[]` array.

The data key `LSP5ReceivedAssetsMap` exists so that smart contracts can detect if an address is present in the array (e.g. as done in the  [LSP1-UniversalReceiverDelegate](./LSP-1-UniversalReceiver.md)).

## Motivation
This standard allows to create a decentralised portfolio of owned assets by a smart contract. See [LSP3 - UniversalProfile Metadata](./LSP-3-UniversalProfile-Metadata.md), or [LSP9 Vault](./LSP-9-Vault.md).

## Specification

Every contract that supports the ERC725Account SHOULD have the following data keys:

### ERC725Y Data Keys


#### LSP5ReceivedAssets[]

An array of received smart contract assets, like tokens (_e.g.: [LSP7 Digital Assets](./LSP-7-DigitalAsset)_) and NFTs (_e.g.: [LSP8 Identifiable Digital Assets](./LSP-8-IdentifiableDigitalAsset)_).


```json
{
    "name": "LSP5ReceivedAssets[]",
    "key": "0x6460ee3c0aac563ccbf76d6e1d07bada78e3a9514e6382b736ed3f478ab7b90b",
    "keyType": "Array",
    "valueType": "address",
    "valueContent": "Address"
}
```

For more info about how to access each index of the `LSP5ReceivedAssets[]` array, see [ERC725Y JSON Schema > `keyType`: `Array`](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/master/LSPs/LSP-2-ERC725YJSONSchema.md#array)

#### LSP5ReceivedAssetsMap

References received smart contract assets, like tokens (_e.g.: [LSP7 Digital Assets](./LSP-7-DigitalAsset)_) and NFTs (_e.g.: [LSP8 Identifiable Digital Assets](./LSP-8-IdentifiableDigitalAsset)_).

The data value MUST be constructed as follows: `bytes4(standardInterfaceId) + bytes8(indexNumber)`. Where:
- `standardInterfaceId` = the [ERC165 interface ID](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165) of the standard that the token or asset smart contract implements (if the ERC165 interface ID is unknown, `standardInterfaceId = 0xffffffff`).
- `indexNumber` = the index in the [`LSP5ReceivedAssets[]` Array](#lsp5receivedassets)

Value example: `0xe33f65c3000000000000000c` (interfaceId: `0xe33f65c3`, index position `0x000000000000000c = 12`).

```json
{
    "name": "LSP5ReceivedAssetsMap:<address>",
    "key": "0x812c4334633eb816c80d0000<address>",
    "keyType": "Mapping",
    "valueType": "(bytes4,bytes8)",
    "valueContent": "(Bytes4,Number)"
}
```

## Rationale

## Implementation

An implementation of setting received assets from a smart contract can be found in the [LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegate](https://github.com/lukso-network/lsp-universalprofile-smart-contracts/blob/main/contracts/LSP1UniversalReceiver/LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateUP/LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateUP.sol) smart contract.

ERC725Y JSON Schema `LSP5ReceivedAssets`:
```json
[
    {
        "name": "LSP5ReceivedAssets[]",
        "key": "0x6460ee3c0aac563ccbf76d6e1d07bada78e3a9514e6382b736ed3f478ab7b90b",
        "keyType": "Array",
        "valueType": "address",
        "valueContent": "Address"
    },
    {
        "name": "LSP5ReceivedAssetsMap:<address>",
        "key": "0x812c4334633eb816c80d0000<address>",
        "keyType": "Mapping",
        "valueType": "(bytes4,bytes8)",
        "valueContent": "(Bytes4,Number)"
    },
]
```
