## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the LIP.-->

A standard interface for digital assets, for either fungible or non-fungible tokens.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->

This standard defines a digital asset standard that can represent either fungible tokens or non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Key functionalities of this asset standard include:

- **Dynamic Information Attachment**: Leverages [ERC725Y] to add generic information to the asset even post-deployment according to the LSP4-DigitalAssetMetadata standard.

- **Secure Transfers**: By checking whether the recipient is capable of handling the asset before the actual transfer, it avoids loss and transfer of tokens to uncontrolled addresses.

- **Transfer Interaction**: Notifies the operator, sender, and the recipient about the transfer, allowing users to be informed about the incoming asset and decide how to react accordingly (e.g., denying the token, forwarding it, etc.).

- **Future-Proof Functionalities**: Through [LSP17-ContractExtension], allows the asset to be extended and support new standardized functions and interface IDs over time.

- **Asset Flexibility and Discoverability**: Offers several flexible features, such as batch transfers and the ability to add several operators, as well as the ability to discover them.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for LIPs that want to change the Lukso protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the LIP solves. LIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The motivation for developing this new digital asset standard can be organized into several key points, each showing a specific limitation of current token standards:

- **Limited Asset Metadata**: Current token standards offer limited metadata attachment capabilities, typically confined to basic elements like `name`, `symbol`, and `tokenURI`. This limitation is particularly restrictive for assets that require verifiable, on-chain metadata â€“ such as details about creators, the community behind the token, or dynamic attributes that allow an NFT to evolve.

- **No Interaction and Notification**: Traditional token standards lack in terms of interaction, particularly in notifying recipients about transfers. As a result, users cannot be unaware of incoming tokens and lose the opportunity to respond, for example, react to transfers, whether to deny, accept, or forward the tokens.

- **Limited Functionalities**: Many tokens are confined to the functionalities they possess at deployment, making them rigid and unable to adapt to new requirements or standards.

- **Risk of asset loss**: A common issue with current assets is the risk of loss due to transfers to incorrect or uncontrolled addresses as these standards does not check whether the recipient is able to handle the asset or not.

- **Limited Features**: The limitation of having only one operator and the absence of batch transfer capabilities or even the discoveribility of tokens a user own restricts and provide bad user experience. Users need to rely on centralized indexers to know which tokens they own, need to do several transactions to do a batch of transfers, and cannot have more than one operator.

## Specification

[ERC165] interface id: `0xb3c4928f`

The LSP7 interface ID is calculated as the XOR of the LSP7 interface (see [interface cheat-sheet below](#interface-cheat-sheet)) and the [LSP17 Extendable interface ID](./LSP-17-ContractExtension.md#erc165-interface-id).

### Methods

#### decimals

```solidity
function decimals() external view returns (uint8);
```

Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.

If the token is non-divisible then `0` SHOULD be used, otherwise `18` is the common value.

**Returns:** `uint8` the number of decimals to tranfrom a token value when displaying.

#### totalSupply

```solidity
function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
```

Returns the number of existing tokens.

**Returns:** `uint256` the number of existing tokens.

#### balanceOf

```solidity
function balanceOf(address tokenOwner) external view returns (uint256);
```

Returns the number of tokens owned by `tokenOwner`.

_Parameters:_

- `tokenOwner` the address to query.

**Returns:** `uint256` the number of tokens owned by this address.

#### authorizeOperator

```solidity
function authorizeOperator(address operator, uint256 amount, bytes memory operatorNotificationData) external;
```

Sets `amount` as the amount of tokens `operator` address has access to from callers tokens.

To increase or decrease the authorized amount of an operator, it's advised to call `revokeOperator(..)` function first, and then call `authorizeOperator(..)` with the new amount to authorize, to avoid front-running through an allowance double-spend exploit.
Check more information [in this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/).

MUST emit an [OperatorAuthorizationChanged event](#OperatorAuthorizationChanged).

_Parameters:_

- `operator` the address to authorize as an operator.
- `amount` the amount of tokens operator has access to.
- `operatorNotificationData` the data to send when notifying the operator via LSP1.

_Requirements:_

#### batchCalls

```solidity
function batchCalls(bytes[] calldata data) external returns (bytes[] memory results);
```

MUST use the [DELEGATECALL] opcode to execute each call in the same context of the current contract.

_Parameters:_

- `data`: an array of encoded function calls to be executed on the current contract.

The data field can be:

- an array of ABI-encoded function calls such as an array of ABI-encoded `transfer`, `authorizeOperator`, `balanceOf` or any LSP8 functions.
- an array of bytes which will resolve to the fallback function to be checked for an extension.

_Requirements:_

- MUST NOT be payable.

_Returns:_ `results` , an array of bytes containing the return values of each executed function call.

### Events

#### Transfer

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 amount, bool force, bytes data);
```

MUST be emitted when `amount` tokens is transferred from `from` to `to`.

#### OperatorAuthorizationChanged

```solidity
event OperatorAuthorizationChanged(address indexed operator, address indexed tokenOwner, uint256 indexed amount, bytes operatorNotificationData);
```

- MUST be emitted when the `operator` allowance of `tokenOwner` changes to `amount` tokens.

#### OperatorRevoked

```solidity
event OperatorRevoked(address indexed operator, address indexed tokenOwner, bool indexed notified, bytes memory operatorNotificationData);
```

- MUST be emitted when the `operator` allowance of `tokenOwner` changes to 0 tokens.

## Rationale

<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

There should be a base token standard for the LSP ecosystem of contracts, which will allow common tooling and clients to be built. Existing tools and clients that expect [ERC20][ERC20] & [ERC777][ERC777] can be made to work with this standard by using "compatability" contract extensions that match the desired interface.

### Operators

To clarify the ability of an address to access tokens from another address, `operator` was chosen as the name for functions, events and variables in all cases. This is originally from [ERC777][ERC777] standard and replaces the `allowance` functionality from [ERC20][ERC20].

### Token Transfers

There is only one transfer function, which is aware of operators. This deviates from [ERC20][ERC20] and [ERC777][ERC777] which added functions specifically for the token owner to use, and for those with access to tokens. By having a single function to call this makes it simple to move tokens, and the caller will be exposed in the `Transfer` event as an indexed value.

### Usage of hooks

When a token is changing owners (minting, transfering, burning) an attempt is made to notify the token sender and receiver using [LSP1 UniversalReceiver][LSP1] interface. The implementation uses `_notifyTokenSender` and `_notifyTokenReceiver` as the internal functions to process this.

The `force` parameter sent during `function transfer` SHOULD be used when notifying the token receiver, to determine if it must support [LSP1 UniversalReceiver][LSP1]. This is used to prevent accidental token transfers, which may results in lost tokens: non-contract addresses could be a copy paste issue, contracts not supporting [LSP1 UniversalReceiver][LSP1] might not be able to move tokens.

## Implementation

<!--The implementations must be completed before any LIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the LIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->

A implementation can be found in the [lukso-network/lsp-smart-contracts][LSP7.sol];
