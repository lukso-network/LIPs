## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the LIP.-->

The LSP8 Identifiable Digital Asset Standard defines a standard interface for uniquely identifiable digital assets. It allows tokens to be uniquely traded and given with metadata using [ERC725Y][erc725] and [LSP4](./LSP-4-DigitalAsset-Metadata.md#lsp4metadata).

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->

This standard defines a digital asset standard that can represent non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Key functionalities of this asset standard include:

- **Flexible Asset Representation**: The tokenId defined in the standard is `bytes32` allowing different tokenId identification including numbers, contract addresses, and any other unique identifiers (_e.g:_ serial numbers, NFTs with unique names, hash values, etc...).

- **Dynamic Information Attachment**: Leverages [ERC725Y] to add generic information to the asset and to each tokenId even post-deployment according to the LSP4-DigitalAssetMetadata standard.

- **Secure Transfers**: By checking whether the recipient is capable of handling the asset before the actual transfer, it avoids loss and transfer of tokens to uncontrolled addresses.

- **Transfer Interaction**: Notifies the operator, sender, and the recipient about the transfer, allowing users to be informed about the incoming asset and decide how to react accordingly (e.g., denying the token, forwarding it, etc.).

- **Future-Proof Functionalities**: Through [LSP17-ContractExtension], allows the asset to be extended and support new standardized functions and interface IDs over time.

- **Asset Flexibility and Discoverability**: Offers several flexible features, such as batch transfers and the ability to add several operators, as well as the ability to discover them.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for LIPs that want to change the Lukso protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the LIP solves. LIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The motivation for developing this new digital asset standard can be organized into several key points, each showing a specific limitation of current token standards:

- **Limited Asset Representation**: Current NFT standards represent tokenId as a simple `uint256` type with no indication about how to parse it, making the NFT very limited.

- **Limited Asset Metadata**: Current token standards offer limited metadata attachment capabilities, typically confined to basic elements like `name`, `symbol`, and `tokenURI`. This limitation is particularly restrictive for assets that require verifiable, on-chain metadata – such as details about creators, the community behind the token, or dynamic attributes that allow an NFT to evolve.

- **No Interaction and Notification**: Traditional token standards lack in terms of interaction, particularly in notifying recipients about transfers. As a result, users cannot be unaware of incoming tokens and lose the opportunity to respond, for example, react to transfers, whether to deny, accept, or forward the tokens.

- **Limited Functionalities**: Many tokens are confined to the functionalities they possess at deployment, making them rigid and unable to adapt to new requirements or standards.

- **Risk of asset loss**: A common issue with current assets is the risk of loss due to transfers to incorrect or uncontrolled addresses as these standards does not check whether the recipient is able to handle the asset or not.

- **Limited Features**: The limitation of having only one operator and the absence of batch transfer capabilities or even the discoveribility of tokens a user own restricts and provide bad user experience. Users need to rely on centralized indexers to know which tokens they own, need to do several transactions to do a batch of transfers, and cannot have more than one operator.

## Specification

[ERC165] interface id: `0x3a271706`

### Metadata

The **LSP8-IdentifiableDigitalAsset** expect the usage of [LSP4-DigitalAsset-Metadata](./LSP-4-DigitalAsset-Metadata.md) to store the metadata of the asset, as well as defining standard data keys to store LSP8 specific metadata.

Data keys such as [`LSP8TokenIdFormat`](#lsp8tokenidformat) or [`LSP4Metadata`](./LSP-4-DigitalAsset-Metadata.md#lsp4metadata) can be stored:

- either for the whole contract using `setData(..)`
- per NFT / tokenId using [`setDataForTokenId(..)`](#setdatafortokenid).

For instance to set metdata for each specific tokenId, set the `LSP4Metadata` data key for each tokenId using `setDataForTokenId(..)` function.

#### ERC725Y Data Keys

#### LSP8TokenIdFormat

```json
{
  "name": "LSP8TokenIdFormat",
  "key": "0xf675e9361af1c1664c1868cfa3eb97672d6b1a513aa5b81dec34c9ee330e818d",
  "keyType": "Singleton",
  "valueType": "uint256",
  "valueContent": "Number"
}
```

The **LSP8-IdentifiableDigitalAsset** standard, defines each `tokenId` as `bytes32`, this data key describes the schema of the `tokenId` and how to parse it and can take one of the following values described in the table below.

| Value | Type / Format | Representation | Description                                                                                                                    |
| :---: | :-----------: | :------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  `0`  |   `uint256`   |     Number     | each NFT is parsed as a **unique number**.                                                                                     |
|  `1`  |   `string`    |     String     | each NFT is parsed as a **unique name** (as a short **utf8 encoded string**, no more than 32 characters long)                  |
|  `2`  |   `address`   | Smart Contract | each NFT is parsed as its **own smart contract** that can hold its own logic and metadata (_e.g [ERC725Y] compatible_).        |
|  `3`  |   `bytes32`   |  Unique Bytes  | each NFT is parsed as a 32 bytes long **unique identifier**.                                                                   |
|  `4`  |   `bytes32`   |      Hash      | each NFT is parsed as a 32 bytes **hash digest**. This can be used as the hash of a very long string representing the tokenId. |

Since tokenIds can have their own custom metadata, it is also possible to have **Mixed types**, where there is a default schema for the collection, and each tokenId can have its own schema, meaning the values can be extended to:

| Value |              Schema               | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :---: | :-------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `100` | `Mixed` with default as `uint256` | Default NFT is parsed as a **unique number** with querying the `LSP8TokenIdFormat` for each `tokenId`.                                                                                |
| `101` | `Mixed` with default as `string`  | Default NFT is parsed as a **unique name** (as a short **utf8 encoded string**, no more than 32 characters long) with querying the `LSP8TokenIdFormat` for each `tokenId`.            |
| `102` | `Mixed` with default as `address` | Default NFT is parsed as its **own smart contract** that can hold its own logic and metadata (_e.g [ERC725Y] compatible_) with querying the `LSP8TokenIdFormat` for each `tokenId`. . |
| `103` | `Mixed` with default as `bytes32` | Default NFT is parsed as a 32 bytes long **unique identifier** with querying the `LSP8TokenIdFormat` for each `tokenId`.                                                              |
| `104` | `Mixed` with default as `bytes32` | Default NFT is parsed as a 32 bytes **hash digest**with querying the `LSP8TokenIdFormat` for each `tokenId`.                                                                          |

To set a specific tokenId type for a specific tokenId, set the `LSP8TokenIdFormat` data key for this specific tokenId using the [`setDataForTokenId(..)`](#setdatafortokenid) function.

A `tokenId` is always represented as a `bytes32` value. Depending on the tokenId types defined above, the padding of the `bytes32` value is different.

| LSP8TokenIdFormat                   | Left padded | Right padded | Padding rule to convert to `bytes32`                                                                                                                                                 |

Some Base URIs could be alterable, for example in the case of NFTs that need their metadata to change overtime.

### ERC725Y Data Keys of external contract for tokenID schema 2 (`address`)

When the LSP8 contract uses the [tokenId schema `4`](#lsp8tokenidformat) (= `address`), each tokenId minted is an ERC725Y smart contract that can have its own metadata.
We refer to this contract as the **tokenId metadata contract**.

In this case, each tokenId present in the LSP8 contract references an other ERC725Y contract.

The **tokenId metadata contract** SHOULD contain the following ERC725Y data key in its storage.

#### LSP8ReferenceContract

This data key stores the address of the LSP8 contract that minted this specific `tokenId` (defined by the address of the **tokenId metadata contract**).

It is a reference back to the LSP8 Collection it comes from.

If the `LSP8ReferenceContract` data key is set, it MUST NOT be changeable.

```json
{
  "name": "LSP8ReferenceContract",
  "key": "0x708e7b881795f2e6b6c2752108c177ec89248458de3bf69d0d43480b3e5034e6",
  "keyType": "Singleton",
  "valueType": "(address,bytes32)",
  "valueContent": "(Address,bytes32)"
}
```

### LSP8 TokenId Metadata

The metadata for a specific of a uniquely identifiable digital asset (when this tokenId is represented by its own ERC725Y contract) can follow the JSON format of the [`LSP4Metadata`](./LSP-4-DigitalAsset-Metadata.md#lsp4metadata) data key.

This JSON format includes an `"attributes"` field to describe unique properties of the tokenId.

## Rationale

<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

There should be a base token standard that allows tracking unique assets for the LSP ecosystem of contracts, which will allow common tooling and clients to be built. Existing tools and clients that expect [ERC721][erc721] can be made to work with this standard by using "compatability" contract extensions that match the desired interface.

### Token Identifier

Every token is identified by a unique `bytes32 tokenId` which SHALL NOT change for the life of the contract. The pair `(contract address, uint256 tokenId)` is globally unique and a fully-qualified identifier for a specific asset on-chain. While some implementations may find it convenient to use the tokenId as an `uint256` that is incremented for each minted token, callers SHALL NOT assume that tokenIds have any specific pattern to them, and MUST treat the tokenId as a "black box". Also note that a tokenId MAY become invalid (when burned).

The choice of `bytes32 tokenId` allows a wide variety of applications including numbers, contract addresses, and hashed values (ie. serial numbers).

### Operators

To clarify the ability of an address to access tokens from another address, `operator` was chosen as the name for functions, events and variables in all cases. This is originally from [ERC777][erc777] standard and replaces the `approve` functionality from [ERC721][erc721].

### Token Transfers

There is only one transfer function, which is aware of operators. This deviates from [ERC721][erc721] and [ERC777][erc777] which added functions specifically for the token owner to use, and for those with access to tokens. By having a single function to call this makes it simple to move tokens, and the caller will be exposed in the `Transfer` event as an indexed value.

### Usage of hooks

When a token is changing owners (minting, transfering, burning) an attempt is made to notify the token sender and receiver using [LSP1 UniversalReceiver][lsp1] interface. The implementation uses `_notifyTokenSender` and `_notifyTokenReceiver` as the internal functions to process this.

The `force` parameter sent during `function transfer` SHOULD be used when notifying the token receiver, to determine if it must support [LSP1 UniversalReceiver][lsp1]. This is used to prevent accidental token transfers, which may results in lost tokens: non-contract addresses could be a copy paste issue, contracts not supporting [LSP1 UniversalReceiver][lsp1] might not be able to move tokens.

## Implementation

<!--The implementations must be completed before any LIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the LIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->

A implementation can be found in the [lukso-network/lsp-smart-contracts][lsp8.sol].
