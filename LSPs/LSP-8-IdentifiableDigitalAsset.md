## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the LIP.-->
A standard interface for identifiable digital assets, allowing for tokens to be uniquely traded and given metadata using [ERC725Y][ERC725].

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
This standard defines an interface for tokens that are identified with a `tokenId`, based on [ERC721][ERC721]. A `bytes32` value is used for `tokenId` to allow many uses of token identification including numbers, contract addresses, and hashed values (ie. serial numbers).

This standard defines a set of key value stores that are useful to know what the `tokenId` represents, and metadata for each `tokenId`.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for LIPs that want to change the Lukso protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the LIP solves. LIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

This standard aims to support use cases not covered by [LSP7 DigitalAsset][LSP7], by using a `tokenId` instead of an amount of tokens to mint, burn, and transfer tokens. Each `tokenId` may have metadata (either as a on-chain [ERC725Y][ERC725] contract or off-chain JSON) in addition to the [LSP4 DigitalAsset-Metadata][LSP4#erc725ykeys] metadata of the smart contract that mints the tokens. In this way a minted token benefits from the flexibility & upgradability of the [ERC725Y][ERC725] standard, and transfering a token carries the history of ownership and metadata updates. This is beneficial for a new generation of NFTs.

A commonality with [LSP7 DigitalAsset][LSP7] is desired so that the two token implementations use similar naming for functions, events, and using hooks to notify token senders and receivers using LSP1.

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (go-ethereum, parity, cpp-ethereum, ethereumj, ethereumjs, and [others](https://github.com/ethereum/wikwi/wiki/Clients)).-->

### ERC725Y Keys

These are the expected keys for the LSP8 contract which mints tokens.

This standard expects the keys from [LSP4 DigitalAsset-Metadata.][LSP4#erc725ykeys].

#### LSP8TokenIdType

TODO: make this look like an enum

What the `tokenId` represents in this contract, to be stored in the [ERC725Y][ERC725] of the contract which mints tokens.

Expected values are represented by the enum:

- 1 -> `uint256`: a number, which may be an incrementing count where each minted token is assigned the next number.
- 2 -> `address`: another contract.
- 3 -> `bytes32`: a hashed value (ie. serial number).

```json
{
    "name": "LSP8TokenIdType",
    "key": "0x715f248956de7ce65e94d9d836bfead479f7e70d69b718d47bfe7b00e05b4fe4",
    "keyType": "Singleton",
    "valueContent": "Number",
    "valueType": "uint256"
}
```

This SHOULD not be changeable, and set only during initialization of the token.

#### LSP8MetadataAddress:TokenId

When a metadata contract is created for a tokenId, the address COULD be stored in the minting contract storage.

```json
{
    "name": "LSP8MetadataAddress:0x20BytesTokenIdHash",
    "key": "0x73dcc7c3c4096cdc00000000cafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe",
    "keyType": "Bytes20Mapping",
    "valueContent": Mixed,
    "valueType": mixed
}
```

For construction of the Bytes20Mapping key see: [LSP2 ERC725Y JSON Schema][LSP2#bytes20mapping]

#### LSP8MetadataJSON:TokenId

When metadata JSON is created for a tokenId, the URL COULD be stored in the minting contract storage.

```json
{
    "name": "LSP8MetadataJSON:0x20BytesTokenIdHash",
    "key": "0x9a26b4060ae7f7d500000000cafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafecafe",
    "keyType": "Bytes20Mapping",
    "valueContent": JSONURL,
    "valueType": bytes
}
```
For construction of the Bytes20Mapping key see: [LSP2 ERC725Y JSON Schema][LSP2#bytes20mapping]
For construction of the JSONURL value see: [LSP2 ERC725Y JSON Schema][LSP2#jsonurl]

---
(TODO: discussion if there are other keys to include in the standard for the contract which mints tokens)
---


#### LSP8TokenIdMetadataMintedBy

The `address` of the contract which minted this tokenId, to be stored in the [ERC725Y][ERC725] of a `tokenId` metadata conract.

```json
{
    "name": "LSP8TokenIdMetadata:MintedBy",
    "key": "0xa0093ef0f6788cc87a372bbd12cf83ae7eeb2c85b87e43517ffd5b3978d356c9",
    "keyType": "Singleton",
    "valueContent": "Address",
    "valueType": "address"
}
```

#### LSP8TokenIdMetadataTokenId

The `bytes32` of the `tokenId` this metadata is for, to be stored in the [ERC725Y][ERC725] of a `tokenId` metadata conract.

```json
{
    "name": "LSP8TokenIdMetadata:TokenId",
    "key": "0x51ea539c2c3a29af57cb4b60be9d43689bfa633dba8613743d1be7fb038d36c3",
    "keyType": "Singleton",
    "valueContent": "Bytes32",
    "valueType": "bytes32"
}
```

---
(TODO: discussion if there are other TokenIdMetadata keys to include in the standard)
---

### ERC725Y keys for off-chain tokenId metadata

#### LSP8TokenIdMetadata

The description of the asset.

```json
{
    "name": "LSP4Metadata",
    "key": "0x9afb95cacc9f95858ec44aa8c3b685511002e30ae54415823f406128b85b238e",
    "keyType": "Singleton",
    "valueContent": "JSONURL",
    "valueType": "bytes"
}
```

For construction of the JSONURL value see: [LSP2 ERC725Y JSON Schema][LSP2#jsonurl]

The linked JSON file SHOULD have the following format:

```json
{
    "LSP8TokenIdMetadata": {
        "mintedBy": "address",
        "tokenId": "bytes32",
    }
}
```

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

There should be a base token standard that allows tracking unique assets for the LSP ecosystem of contracts, which will allow common tooling and clients to be built. Existing tools and clients that expect [ERC721][ERC721] can be made to work with this standard by using "compatability" contract extensions that match the desired interface.

### Token Identifier

Every token is identified by a unique `bytes32 tokenId` which SHALL NOT change for the life of the contract. The pair `(contract address, uint256 tokenId)` is globally unique and a fully-qualified identifier for a specific asset on-chain. While some implementations may find it convenient to use the tokenId as an `uint256` that is incremented for each minted token, callers SHALL NOT assume that tokenIds have any specific pattern to them, and MUST treat the tokenId as a "black box". Also note that a tokenId MAY become invalid (when burned).

The choice of `bytes32 tokenId` allows a wide variety of applications including numbers, contract addresses, and hashed values (ie. serial numbers).

### Operators

To clarify the ability of an address to access tokens from another address, `operator` was chosen as the name for functions, events and variables in all cases. This is originally from [ERC777][ERC777] standard and replaces the `approve` functionality from [ERC721][ERC721].

### Token Transfers

There is only one transfer function, which is aware of operators. This deviates from [ERC721][ERC721] and [ERC777][ERC777] which added functions specifically for the token owner to use, and for those with access to tokens. By having a single function to call this makes it simple to move tokens, and the caller will be exposed in the `Transfer` event as an indexed value.

### Usage of hooks

When a token is changing owners (minting, transfering, burning) an attempt is made to notify the token sender and receiver using [LSP1 UniversalReceiver][LSP1] interface. The implementation uses `_notifyTokenSender` and `_notifyTokenReceiver` as the internal functions to process this.

The `force` parameter sent during `function transfer` SHOULD be used when notifying the token receiver, to determine if it must support [LSP1 UniversalReceiver][LSP1]. This is used to prevent accidental token transfers, which may results in lost tokens: non-contract addresses could be a copy paste issue, contracts not supporting [LSP1 UniversalReceiver][LSP1] might not be able to move tokens.

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any LIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the LIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->

A implementation can be found in the [lukso-network/lsp-smart-contracts][LSP8Core.sol];
